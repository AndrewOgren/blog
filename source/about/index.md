Hi, I'm Andrew. Welcome to my blog. I created this with the knowledge that likely no one will ever read it. However, if you're interested in what I'm reading, what I'm thinking, or what I'm eating, you've come to the right place. 

I'm currently a software engineer at Grubhub. I studied computer science at Dartmouth College. If you're interested in what I'm up to, connect with me on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/andrewogren1). Or email me at andrewogren02@gmail.com.
